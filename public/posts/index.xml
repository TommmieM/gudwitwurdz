      <description>Yeah, I know I know, less focus than a 1940s film projector. This time, though, I&amp;rsquo;m pretty sure I&amp;rsquo;ve got the direction I actually want to go. I enjoy teaching concepts and only enough specificity to get things done. Current plan is to create a learning path series that will carry a person from first steps with Linux all the way through to building a personal project that relies on a backbone that can be transferred to real-world applications and re-created to produce actual results.</description>

&lt;p&gt;I know, less focus than a 1940s film projector. This time, though, I&amp;rsquo;m pretty sure I&amp;rsquo;ve got the direction I actually want to go. I enjoy teaching concepts and only enough specificity to get things done. Current plan is to create a learning path series that will carry a person from first steps with Linux all the way through to building a personal project that relies on a backbone that can be transferred to real-world applications and re-created to produce actual results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This began out of a conversation with a friend saying she wishes she could do the things I do. My response, probably a bit flippantly, was to say that she could. Anyone can. The things I do for work and fun with a computer are matters of skills, not &amp;ldquo;talent&amp;rdquo;. Of course, that led to a conversation, fueled by the excellent &lt;a href=&#34;https://roadmap.sh/devops&#34;&gt;DevOps Roadmap&lt;/a&gt;, about everything that I put together in order to do these things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also made me realize, I look at that roadmap and think, &amp;ldquo;Yeah, that&amp;rsquo;s about right&amp;rdquo;. From the outside looking in, that roadmap is intimidating as hell. Eliciting thoughts of &amp;ldquo;How the hell do I learn all of that?&amp;rdquo; The short answer, though, is: You don&amp;rsquo;t!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within each section, there are solid topics to learn, but more importantly, there are concepts to grasp. In correlation with these concepts, there are tools at your disposal. So long as you can grasp the concepts, and understand the tools, you can work with them to build and do some things that are impressive. So that is what I&amp;rsquo;m going to break these things down to, concepts and tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just like real tools, knowing what they are used for, and understanding how they can apply are limiting knowledge. Actually putting the tools to use are where things get interesting, and actual learning begins. You can learn the intricacies of mitre saws, laser levels, nail sizes, joinery&amp;hellip; But until you actually try to put together a table, you aren&amp;rsquo;t a carpenter. So while we will begin with concepts, very quickly, we are going to move forward to projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The projects I put forward are NOT to be followed. They are to be thought of as inspiration. To continue the carpentry comparison, think of it as someone watching an episode of The New Yankee Workshop (that&amp;rsquo;s still on, right?), and deciding they are going to build a chair that way. Their chair will be their own. You might still recognize it as an Adirondack, but it will not look the same. Some parts of construction, some design concepts in the aesthetic, and, frankly, the worksmanship of it will not match. That&amp;rsquo;s a good thing. Individualize the work. Make it your own, change what it looks like, how it works, even some underlying concepts. Take your time, do the project for you, just use the tools I give you. That&amp;rsquo;s how you learn to become a useful programmer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next time, a roadmap of what is going to happen. Please note, that roadmap isn&amp;rsquo;t finished being drawn up. It may change, it may grow, it may shrink. During each time that the articles for each part are published, the roadmap will be updated to link to them. If you want to follow along, it may be a good idea to bookmark it.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>A Forced Focus So, as I admitted a bit in my previous posts, I am currently unemployed. After looking into the situation that has put me in, as well as my skills, drives, and goals for myself, it has led to a bit of a refocus for the way this site is going to go, and what that means going forward. This comes after a lot of thought with a career counselor, resume reviews, and just what I do with my spare time to keep myself from going insane.</description>
      <content>&lt;h1 id=&#34;a-forced-focus&#34;&gt;A Forced Focus&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, as I admitted a bit in my previous posts, I am currently unemployed. After looking into the situation that has put me in, as well as my skills, drives, and goals for myself, it has led to a bit of a refocus for the way this site is going to go, and what that means going forward. This comes after a lot of thought with a career counselor, resume reviews, and just what I do with my spare time to keep myself from going insane. It also caused an evaluation of what I want and need from a job going forward in order to survive and thrive. As you can tell from these themes, it is going to get a bit personal. If that isn&amp;rsquo;t your cup of tea, I understand. Please also understand, I don&amp;rsquo;t publish this to lament my lot in life, but to show others that may be in a similar position by fate and happenstance, you are not alone. It is completely okay to reevaluate life, and decide what you want and need from it. Hopefully, my process helps those folks understand that this is not a bad thing, if you find yourself needing to, evaluate your life, and make it into something more tolerable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of all, the circumstances I lost my previous job under have some people that I have spoken to about it calling it unfair. I disagree. Those circumstances were that I was under a 90 day probation period at the job. It was laid out to me before I took the job that there was a very strict policy on missed time during that period. If I missed three days, the job was terminated. While my circumstances for missing those days were medical (I had an IBS flare up that caused severe pain, a suspected obstruction), it doesn&amp;rsquo;t change the fact that the job I undertook was a physical one in the tech field, with presence required for the business model to work. They laid that out, and I accepted, knowing my own medical history and not foreclosing that information during the hiring process. If there is anyone to blame for the job being offered and then rescinded within two weeks, it is myself, not my former employer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That being said, it has caused me to reevaluate my life, both work and personal, when it comes to managing my illness. I have come to admit that it is, indeed, a handicap. It is not one that prevents me from working. It is just one that prevents me from leaving the house occasionally. In my job previous as a help desk analyst, I was working primarily from home. If need be, I was taking days off due to these issues when they got severe, but when it was about the same as what caused the missed days at my last job, more often than not, I would work. When need arose, I would get off the phones, and then I would return. Even on those days, despite the missed time, I was often a KPI leader in calls taken, and was seen as a bit of a leader on knowledge of the procedures and processes we were expected to follow. Lack of ability to be in office DOES NOT EQUATE to lack of ability to be a valuable team member.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of that, I am going to be more up front with this disability, and admit it as such on applications. I am going to ask for flex accomodations to be able to work from home as needed to continue contributing to my work. However, I am going to limit the scope of jobs I look for in the tech field. As mentioned, the last job I had was physical. It involved running cables, installing hardware, and physically assuring system availability and operation when needed. That is not something I can reliably do. I realized that, and started, initially, looking to get back into web development, either front or back end, and slinging code. This is something I have done before. It is also something I quickly burned out on before. Not least of which because usually, the work is mainly front end that is usually desired. I have the artistic ability of a parapalegic newt, I am not the person you want implementing something that is supposed to look pretty or useful! Can I do the job? Yes. I have done it before. Same with back end, can I do it? Yes. In fact, knowledge of back end requirements, what is possible, and thinking outside the box to achieve unusual requests were one of the things that got me notied by a former co-worker that was apparently so appreciative of that skill that even six months after our last conversation, she is still giving me alerts to when new jobs come up that I can fit with where she now works. (If you see this, yet again, THANK YOU! I don&amp;rsquo;t care if you get tired of hearing that, I&amp;rsquo;ll keep saying it, because it really does mean that much.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, though, trying to put together a portfolio for that end of things reminded me, I don&amp;rsquo;t really want to have to kludge together any more bad code to fix errant requests to make systems work in ways that they shouldn&amp;rsquo;t because there was no design put into the evolution of said systems that have now grown out of spec. And let&amp;rsquo;s face it, that is pretty much the definition of back-end work. So I was left with a conundrum. Where to take my talents and skills?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I began looking into what I do just because I am bored. I like baseball, but I haven&amp;rsquo;t watched a game in years. To me, part of the allure of baseball is that you don&amp;rsquo;t have to be able to watch it to be able to appreciate it. A look at the box scores can tell you, if you know how to read them, everything that happened over the course of four hours on a patch of grass, hundreds of miles away from you, among twenty or so people. A glance at a standings sheet and roster report can give you a fair idea of what will happen tomorrow among a different grouping of the same size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to games, I love to play them. Video game preferences for me run away from war and shooting, and towards simulation and stratgey. In well made strategy games, either through game menus or observational play, you get to know what situation you are in, and can formulate a plan or new goal based on the resources available to you. For simulations, the same thing arise, whether that simulation be something like SimCity, or a bit more complex, like Dwarf Fortress. Even when the numbers are hidden from view, the systems can be figured out to a degree that allows interaction with a system in a meaningful way to create situations out of seeming chaos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That has led me to thinking, data and business analytics is simply using known data to react to chaotic systems such as economy, climate change, and the unexpected in the most meaningful way possible. Do I think it will have the same fun factor as playing Dwarf Fortress, or running a Monte Carlo simulation on a possible baseball outcome? No, I&amp;rsquo;m not stupid. Work is to complete tasks for others, and to make ends meet. Play is for the other stuff. But at least with this field, I know what I&amp;rsquo;m getting into, I cannot be sold a bill of goods on changing the world, or getting rich. I&amp;rsquo;m making information more visible to make decisions more apparent, and trying to remove any possible clouds from that judgement by relating facts that may be uncomfortable. That&amp;rsquo;s not fun, but that is life, and that is something I can accept.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it&amp;rsquo;s something I can do from an office, or from home. So it may just be the most perfect fit for what my life is now that I have taken a look at my life&amp;rsquo;s own data, without bias, and accepted, I&amp;rsquo;m a bit less capable than most. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t make me useless, it just makes me less of a physical presence. But I&amp;rsquo;ve already proven, I don&amp;rsquo;t have to be present to be an impact. And I&amp;rsquo;m going to make an impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, that was a lot of words, what does that mean for this site going forward? Well, for starters, while I&amp;rsquo;m not likely to do away completely with the HTML/CSS/JavaScript track, it isn&amp;rsquo;t going to be a priority. Honestly, I now the information, and know it well, but other than the JavaScript side, it just isn&amp;rsquo;t me. Those other parts are presentation, and I&amp;rsquo;m a newt, remember? I&amp;rsquo;m going to keep going with teaching, because I have quite a few transferable skills. Recently, I got involved in a study group for those breaking into data analysis and I am looking at the information on different aspects that cross over to my old jobs, and I can understand why people are frustrated thinking they can never get this. Do you really need an eight hour tutorial on database design where the first hour and a half is spent trying to clumsily define what data and a database are? Or, as a beginner, do you need just enough information to be able to take an already known-clean data set and shove it into a database in order to begin some analysis?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frankly, I think getting people up and running with the tools they need as fast as possible beats the hell out of that. You shouldn&amp;rsquo;t need to take in enough information to be an entry-level database admin in order to get up and running with entry-level data analysis. For goodness sake, if that were the case, the field is vastly underpaid! So I&amp;rsquo;m going to pivot a bit, and give a few tutorials on how to take a known clean dataset, how to evaluate that dataset in order to build the database it needs, and then import the damn thing. Then analyze it, and possibly use HTML/CSS/JavaScript to make a static page to publish a report. Then, if you are still interested, we&amp;rsquo;ll go above that and get some not so clean data, and work on the more advanced stuff. But not until we already have something to show for ourselves, dammit!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until then, thanks for bearing with me through all of that. I look forward to posting again, soon.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Tutorial 1 Getting Started With HTML</title>
      <link>/posts/tutorial-1-getting-started-with-html/</link>

      <description>Let&amp;rsquo;s Go! So, here we go. The set up tutorial. If you remember the old blog about this, don&amp;rsquo;t panic. This is going to be a lot easier. Set up is streamlined a lot. In fact, we are going to get into talking about HTML in this tutorial, set up and first steps are all in one lesson now! Let&amp;rsquo;s f^&amp;amp;centkin&#39; do this!
Editor Set Up So, if you are interested in web development, I&amp;rsquo;m going to assume you have access to the internet in some fashion.</description>
      <content>&lt;h1 id=&#34;lets-go&#34;&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s Go!&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, here we go. The set up tutorial. If you remember the old blog about this, don&amp;rsquo;t panic. This is going to be a lot easier. Set up is streamlined a lot. In fact, we are going to get into talking about HTML in this tutorial, set up and first steps are all in one lesson now! Let&amp;rsquo;s f^&amp;amp;centkin&#39; do this!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;editor-set-up&#34;&gt;Editor Set Up&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, if you are interested in web development, I&amp;rsquo;m going to assume you have access to the internet in some fashion. Thus, we are going to edit the code online. If you go to &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.codepen.io&#34;&gt;CodePen&lt;/a&gt;, you can sign up for free, and have at your fingertips editors with colored syntax highlighting for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This should open this set of instruction for everyone, whether you have a desktop, laptop, or even just your cell phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you are signed up, and signed in, of course, just click on the menu and choose &amp;ldquo;New Pen&amp;rdquo;. There you go. You are set up. The editors are separated for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, either in separate editors available on your screen, or through tabs, depending on the size of your screen. There you are. You&amp;rsquo;re all set up. Seriously, that&amp;rsquo;s it. Why are you still here? Move on to the next section.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;intro-to-html&#34;&gt;Intro to HTML&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most important thing with learning anything with computers, from HTML to C++ to a word processor, is to play. So for today, I&amp;rsquo;m not going to cover the syntax and usage of HTML. I&amp;rsquo;m simply going to introduce the documentation and how to navigate it. After you become familiar with how the documentation is laid out, read it and play a bit. Don&amp;rsquo;t worry about the CSS and JavaScript editors in CodePen for now. Just play around with the HTML and what it does when you put it on the screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best documentation on the internet for HTML syntax is the Mozilla Developer Network (MDN) documents. These can be found &lt;a href=&#34;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. It is honestly best if you bookmark this. This reference is invaluable. Another thing to keep in mind is that the Mozilla Foundation, the folks that maintain this reference, as well as make the Firefox web browser, is a non-profit. There is no sign up, and none of your data is tracked. Because of that, Mozilla is funded through donations. If you can, please &lt;a href=&#34;https://donate.mozilla.org/en-US/&#34;&gt;donate&lt;/a&gt; to Mozilla so they can keep up their great work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just to come up to speed on the documentation, if you click on the menu on your phone&amp;rsquo;s screen at the top-left (or in the left sidebar on your computer screen), you will see a section at the top that says &lt;strong&gt;Tutorials&lt;/strong&gt;. Please read through at least the HTML Basics tutorial. It is best if you can read through the entirety of the four tutorials listed, but they are very lengthy and dense, so I understand if you don&amp;rsquo;t. Just remember that they are there and come back to them when you can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And don&amp;rsquo;t worry if it takes several read-throughs before you begin to understand what they are talking about. If you don&amp;rsquo;t get it, simply take notes on what is being said, plug it into CodePen, and then change it a bit to see how it affects the outcome, and finally re-read that part of the tutorial. We will go through some things in the next few weeks, but for the most part, these documents are well-written enough that I am going to trust that between reading and experimenting, you can figure it out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, until next week&amp;rsquo;s tutorial, read through the docs, have CodePen open while you do, and experiment. Next time, we will go through some of the most frequently used tags in HTML and speak about what they do, and get to where we can get something resembling a web page up in front of us. The following week, we will cover some of the more advanced topics of attributes to tags and their effects, as well as building our first forms and tables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In week four, we move on to CSS. As you can see, this is &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; fast paced. I am relying on you taking some part of the week between each post to get your hands dirty in CodePen and actually making a few shitty web pages. And yes, they are shitty. First web pages always are, especially when dealing with only HTML. Don&amp;rsquo;t fear this. We development is a creative endeavor akin to writing, and &lt;a href=&#34;https://wrd.as.uky.edu/sites/default/files/1-Shitty%20First%20Drafts.pdf&#34;&gt;shitty first drafts&lt;/a&gt; are invaluable in writing!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until next week, have fun, and keep learning!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>What&amp;rsquo;s Next Here So just an update now that I&amp;rsquo;ve decided what to do with this site. This update is actually a day late from when it was supposed to go out.
That&amp;rsquo;s because on Wednesday&amp;rsquo;s I&amp;rsquo;m going to be adding updates on what I&amp;rsquo;m working on beside the tutorials, or launch a completed project. Fridays, I will be posting a tutorial akin to what was on the now defunct blog site.</description>

&lt;p&gt;So just an update now that I&amp;rsquo;ve decided what to do with this site. This update is actually a day late from when it was supposed to go out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s because on Wednesday&amp;rsquo;s I&amp;rsquo;m going to be adding updates on what I&amp;rsquo;m working on beside the tutorials, or launch a completed project. Fridays, I will be posting a tutorial akin to what was on the now defunct blog site. It will be started all over from scratch, but with a more compact view of HTML and CSS, and with minimal set up! Following along this time will not require any installation on your computer, and can even be followed along with on your phone. The internet is amazing, ain&amp;rsquo;t it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So that&amp;rsquo;s it, just a short update. Check in tomorrow for the set up and a look into the first steps of HTML. Fair warning, because of the more compact view of HTML that will be taken, there will be more reading and work off of this blog.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>COMING SOON Within the coming weeks, this site will expand greatly beyond the current static blog you are reading now. This is, after all, my portfolio! It should show this, I think, if it is going to be effective in helping me get a job.
First thing that will be done, I am going to be uploading some JavaScript games. Simple games will be the first as I gain some further familiarity with using JavaScript to make games, but gaining in complexity quickly.</description>
      <content>&lt;h1 id=&#34;coming-soon&#34;&gt;COMING SOON&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within the coming weeks, this site will expand greatly beyond the current static blog you are reading now. This is, after all, my portfolio! It should show this, I think, if it is going to be effective in helping me get a job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First thing that will be done, I am going to be uploading some JavaScript games. Simple games will be the first as I gain some further familiarity with using JavaScript to make games, but gaining in complexity quickly. As I will be creating my own art assets, the games pages will be linking to the repositories with that art. Having no musical talent beyond karaoke (and then only in my own mind), the sound in the games will be properly credited below each game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, I will be putting up more posts as were previously seen on &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.blog.gudwitwurdz.click&#34;&gt;blog.gudwitwurdz.click&lt;/a&gt;. Starting with porting over those previous posts and then expanding them. If you were following that (who are you?), those posts will continue, stay tuned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, this site is currently built with Hugo using the Terminal template. Credit is at the bottom of every page if you would like to contact the creator of the template. I will be looking into creating my own template and personalizing this template, as well.&lt;/p&gt;
